## Project Description

My project takes a .csv file from a dataset of 10,000 books from Goodreads (found on kaggle.com) and from that data creates a database with two tables: books and authors. For the purposes of this program, I have limited the insertion of data into the database to the first 2,000 books from the dataset. The program then creates a flask app that allows a user to search through the database. The user can query books by author in order to get a list of books written by the author. The user can also query books by a search term, which will return a list of books that have said search term in the title. The user can also query the database by the title of the book and the app will return an image of the book cover.

## How to run

1. First, you should install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download files needed to run the program (templates folder, static folder, books_clean.csv) and make sure they are in the same directory as the program file (book_tools.py)
2. Then, you should run 'python3 book_tools.py' in your terminal
3. Once you run the program in the terminal, you can navigate to localhost5000: and use the app

## How to use

1. When the user navigates to localhost:5000 They will be taken to the homepage with links to the rest of the routes.
2. The user can navigate to the author route, which will populate a form where the user can input information and the app will return a list of books written by that author that are in the Database
3. The user can navigate to the search route, which will populate a form where the user can input a search term (ex: "car" or "harry" or "magic") and the app will return a list of books with titles that contain that search term.
4. The user can navigate to the bookcover route that will populate a form that allows the user to input the title of a book and the app will return an image of the book's cover.
5. The user can always navigate to the information route which will give the user an overview of the functionality of the app.
6. It is important to note that correct spelling of the author and title are very important. The queries are not case sensitive, but correct spelling is necessary.
7. Please look in "screenshot" directory for views of what the app should look like when it is run.

## Routes in this application
- `/` -> this is the home page of the application with a welcome message and links to the other routes
- `/information` -> this route has a bit of information about what the app does and allows the user to navigate to the other routes in the app
- `/author` -> this route has a form for user input for the name of an author and will return a list of books written by the author
- `/search` -> this route has a form that will accept user input for a search term, and then returns a list of all the titles that contain the search term
- `/bookcover` -> this route also had a form that accept the title of a book and returns the image of the bookcover

## How to run tests
1. First make sure the file SI507project_tests.py is in the same directory as the rest of the files
2. Run the app program and navigate to localhost:5000 so that the database is created
3. Run the test file: SI507project_tests.py in your terminal
